**ADSP: The Podcast** is an informal podcast inspired by [Magic Read Along](http://www.magicreadalong.com/). We plan to talk about whatever we feel like - algorithms, data structures, programming languages, latest news in tech and more. Feel free to follow us on Twitter at [@adspthepodcast](https://twitter.com/adspthepodcast).

Your two co-hosts are:

### Bryce Adelstein Lelbach

Bryce Adelstein Lelbach (he/him) has spent nearly a decade developing programming languages and software libraries. Bryce is passionate about programming language evolution and is one of the leaders of the C++ community. Bryce chairs [INCITS PL22](https://www.incits.org/committees/pl22), the US standards committee for programming languages. He is also an officer of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21, [the Standard C++ Committee](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee). He chairs the C++ Library Design group (LEWG); previously he chaired the C++ Tooling group (SG15) and the Library Incubator group (SG18). On the C++ Committee, he has personally worked on parallel algorithms, coroutines, executors, futures, senders/receivers, multidimensional arrays, and modules. He is also the program chair for the [C++Now](https://cppnow.org/) and [CppCon](https://cppcon.org/) conferences, and the chief organizer of the Bay Area C++ User Group. Bryce works at NVIDIA, focusing on programming language design and evolution. He leads the CUDA C++ Core Libraries team and works on the NVIDIA HPC compiler. He is one of the initial developers of the HPX parallel runtime system.
