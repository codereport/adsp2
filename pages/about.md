**ADSP: The Podcast** is a programming podcast hosted by three software engineers (Conor, Bryce and Ben) that focuses on the C++ and Rust programming languages. Topics discussed include algorithms, data structures, programming languages, latest news in tech and more. The podcast was initially inspired by [Magic Read Along](http://www.magicreadalong.com/). Feel free to follow us on Twitter at [@adspthepodcast](https://twitter.com/adspthepodcast).

The three co-hosts are:

### Conor Hoekstra 

**Twitter:** [@code_report](https://twitter.com/code_report)
 
Conor (he/him) is a [Research Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conorhoekstra/) at NVIDIA working on array programming models and languages. He is extremely passionate about programming languages, algorithms and beautiful code. He is the founder and organizer of the [Programming Languages Virtual Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Programming-Languages-Toronto-Meetup/), he has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/codereport) and is the host of four podcasts: 

* [ADSP](https://adspthepodcast.com/) (this podcast)
* [ArrayCast](https://www.arraycast.com/) (a podcast about array languages)
* [Tacit Talk](https://tacittalk.com/) (a podcast about array languages and tacit programming)
* [R4](https://r4podcast.com/) (a running podcast)

Conor is also an avid conference speaker. You can find all of Conor's conference talks and podcast appearances (on other podcasts) [here](https://github.com/codereport/Talks/blob/master/README.md).

### Bryce Adelstein Lelbach 

**Twitter:** [@blelbach](https://twitter.com/blelbach)

Bryce Adelstein Lelbach (he/him) has spent over a decade developing programming languages, compilers, and software libraries. He is a Principal Architect at NVIDIA, where he leads HPC programming language efforts and drives the technical roadmap for NVIDIAâ€™s HPC compilers and libraries. Bryce is passionate about C++ and is one of the leaders of the C++ community. He has served as chair of [INCITS/PL22](https://www.incits.org/committees/pl22), the US standards committee for programming languages and [the Standard C++](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) Library Evolution group. Bryce served as the program chair for the [C++Now](https://cppnow.org/) and [CppCon](https://cppcon.org/) conferences for many years. On the C++ Committee, he has personally worked on concurrency primitives, parallel algorithms, executors, and multidimensional arrays. He is one of the founding developers of the HPX parallel runtime system. Outside of work, Bryce is passionate about airplanes and watches.

### Ben Deane

**Twitter:** [@ben_deane](https://x.com/ben_deane)

Ben has been programming in C++ for this whole millennium. He spent just over 20 years in the games industry working for companies like EA and Blizzard; many of the games he worked on used to be fondly remembered but now he's accepted that they are probably mostly forgotten. After getting more interested in modern C++, in the teens he started giving internal company talks and then [talks at various conferences](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVFrD1dmDdvea7aPDCrp9A1EAU3DLw7GE), spreading ideas about types, algorithms and [declarative and functional techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ouxETt75R4). In 2018 he left the games industry and worked in finance for a short spell, writing high-frequency trading platforms using the most modern C++ that compilers could support. Now he is a [Principal Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elbeno) at Intel where he puts monads inside your CPU.
