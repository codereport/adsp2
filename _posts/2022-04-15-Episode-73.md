**About the Guests:**

**[Jason Walter](https://twitter.com/jason_d_walter)** is a lead tool programmer at [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home) Canada working on the Virtual Production Tools teams. He is on the board of directors of [CppToronto](https://twitter.com/CPPToronto), a non-profit organization that provides an open, inclusive, and collaborative place where software developers can meet and discuss topics related to C++ software development and currently an organizing member of the [CppNorth](https://cppnorth.ca/) conference.  In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his family, photography, and riding his road and gravel bike.

**[Patrice Roy](https://twitter.com/patriceroy1)** has been playing with C++, either professionally, for pleasure or (most of the time) both for over 30 years. After a few years doing R&D and working on military flight simulators, he moved on to academics and has been [teaching computer science since 1998](http://h-deb.clg.qc.ca/). Since 2005, he’s been involved more specifically in helping graduate students and professionals from the fields of real-time systems and game programming develop the skills they need to face today’s challenges. The rapid evolution of C++ in recent years has made his job even more enjoyable.

He’s been a participating member in the ISO C++ Standards Committee since late 2014 and has been involved with the ISO Programming Language Vulnerabilities since late 2015. He has five kids, and his wife ensures their house is home to a continuously changing number of cats, dogs and other animals.
