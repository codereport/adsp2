### About the Guest

[Barry Revzin](https://twitter.com/BarryRevzin) is a senior C++ developer at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com/) in Chicago, a research and technology driven trading firm. After programming for many years, he got really into the nuances and intricacies of C++ by being unreasonably active on StackOverflow (where he is the top contributor in C++14, C++17, and C++20). A lot of his C++ knowledge comes from just answering questions that he doesn't know the answers to, especially when he answers them incorrectly at first.

His C++ involvement escalated when he started attending standards committee meetings in 2016, having written dozens of papers for C++20 and now C++23. You might know him from such features as <=>, pack expansion in lambda init-capture, explicit(bool), conditionally trivial special member functions and, recently approved for C++23, deducing this.

Outside of the C++ world, Barry is an obsessive swimming fan. He writes fun data articles for [SwimSwam](https://swimswam.com/) and also does analysis for the DC Trident, a professional swim team featuring Olympic Gold Medalists Zach Apple and Anna Hopkin, managed by two-time Olympian Kaitlin Sandeno.
