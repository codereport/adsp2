**About the Guests:**

[Bernhard](https://x.com/BernhardMGruber) is a senior system software engineer at NVIDIA, where he extends, optimizes and maintains the [CUDA Core Compute Libraries (CCCL)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl). Previously, he worked as software engineer among physicists at CERN on real-time and embedded software for the Large Hadron Collider, as well as data layout abstractions for heterogeneous architectures, for which he received a PhD in High Performance Computing from the University of Dresden, Germany. Before, he implemented GPU accelerated simulations and 3D visualizations of industrial machining processes. Since 2022, Bernhard is a voting member of WG21 and his interests span geometry, 3D visualizations, optimization, SIMD, GPU computing, refactoring and teaching C++.

[Koen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpoppe) is an engineer specializing in high-quality software with a strong mathematical foundation. With a PhD in Computer Science from KU Leuven, his work bridges applied mathematics and performance-critical software engineering. As Team Lead for HMI Software at NV Michel Van de Wiele, he focuses on developing C++/Qt applications for textile production systems, optimizing performance, usability, and cloud integration. Passionate about elegant, efficient solutions, Koen brings deep expertise in numerical methods, system optimization, and software architecture.
