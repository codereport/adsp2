**About the Guests:**

[Ray](https://x.com/rayburgemeestre) is a Senior Systems Software Engineer at NVIDIA since 2022. Studied Software Engineering at the University of Amsterdam. Founded the Dutch C++ Meetup in 2013 and co-organizes C++ Under the Sea since 2023. He has been programming for more than 25 years, his journey began on his father's Panasonic CF-2700 MSX--and has been hooked ever since. He is also 'the listener' of ADSP the podcast.

Paul Grosse-Bley was first introduced to parallel programming with C+MPI at a student exchange to Umeå (Sweden) in 2017 while studying Physics. In the following years he learned more about MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC, Thrust/parSTL and CUDA C++. After finishing his Master's degree in Physics at Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2021, he became a PhD candidate in Computational Science and Engineering researching the acceleration of iterative solvers in sparse linear algebra while being head-tutor for a course on GPU Algorithm Design. He learned using Thrust in 2019 shortly before learning  C++ and became enamored with parallel algorithms which led to numerous answers on StackOverflow, contributions on GitHub, his NVIDIA internship in the summer of 2025 and full position starting in February of 2026.
