**About the Guests:**

[Chandler Carruth](https://twitter.com/chandlerc1024) leads the C++, [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) teams at Google, building a better language with better diagnostics, tools, compilers, optimizers, etc. Previously, he worked on several pieces of Google’s distributed build system. He makes guest appearances helping to maintain a few core C++ libraries across Google’s codebase, and is active in the LLVM and Clang open source communities. He received his M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science from Wake Forest University, but disavows all knowledge of the contents of his Master’s thesis. He is regularly found drinking Cherry Coke Zero in the daytime and pontificating over a single malt scotch in the evening.

[Patricia Aas](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo) is a C++ programmer with a "thing for building browsers". She works for a company she co-founded called [TurtleSec](https://turtlesec.no/) where she teaches courses in Secure Coding in C++ and does consulting and contracting. She has been a professional programmer for 16 years, and started off her career working on the original [Opera browser](https://www.opera.com/). Since then she has made embedded products at Cisco and another browser at [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/). When she has time she works on her own open source (pre-alpha) Chromium/Blink+Qt based browser called [TurtleBrowser](https://github.com/turtlebrowser/turtlebrowser).
