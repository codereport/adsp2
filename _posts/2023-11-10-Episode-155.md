**About the Guest:**

[Jonathan O'Connor](https://twitter.com/ninkibah) in 1988 joined Glockenspiel, a small Irish company. C++ had no virtual destructors, but it did have a coroutine library! I spent 2 years teaching C++ and OOP. In 2000, he switched over to Java. But by 2010, he started 7 wonderful years writing in Ruby. In 2016, he returned to a completely different C++, where one never had to see a pointer if you didn't want to. These days he is helping to make the world a better place writing C++ code for LADE GmbH, a company building electric car charging infrastructure.
